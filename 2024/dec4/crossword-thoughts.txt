this feels like a good case for recursion
we iterate through each letter, check if it's either an X or an S
- if yes then we start the recursion, looking for the next letters in XMAS, either forward or backwards
  - this will search all (valid) surrounding indeces for the next letter, recursing on each one it finds
- if we get to the end of XMAS we return 1, otherwise 0? to add to the count?

need some way to know what letter is next, and what letter is the end for the base case
