the way to find the loops is closing boxes
- every box has an obstacle at each corner
- every potential location for an obstacle is the fourth corner for a box where there is an obstacle in front of each corner

- if I define a vector for each obstacle, meaning a line through the map with the direction the guard would be traveling in the normal path for them to hit it,
  and track the intersections between the guards path and these obstacle vectors
  - then for each vector hit follow that path until I end up outside the map or back at the guard?
    - if I end up outside I exit to the original loop and continue until I hit the next vector
    - if I end up back at the guard I increment the count and exit to the original loop and continue

I think this will work, it's kind of a brute force approach, but a little more informed

new approach
- can I go through the path, knowing the direction at each point, check if I put an obstacle in front of it and
  turn, will I reconnect with another path moving in the same direction?
- if I have, then I know I've entered a loop


ok so actually I can do this in one pass I think
- I need to modifiy the condition where I check for 'X', because now my path will hold the direction that I was moving

- first guess 466 was too low, got 465 and added one to see if I was missing the end
- second guess 814 was also too low, got 813 and added one 
    - I didn't stop the search at an obstacle
- third guess was 1895, still too low?
- fourth guess was 5814
- 5th was 1898
- 6th was 2183
    - realized I wasn't counting the loops back to the added obstacle
- 7th was 1908
